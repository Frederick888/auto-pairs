Auto-pairs is mostly compatible with vim-visual-multi (VM). This fork also
sets up config to make sure the plugin is correctly disabled and respects the
plugin as far as it can. However, that's also the problem.

VM overrides keybinds, and doesn't try to map them in a way that's compatible
with other maps. While there are keys like that in auto-pairs wrt. other
plugins (and some times vice versa), VM gives plugins a way out.

Using |g:VM_plugins_compatibilty| (see also |vm-compatibility|), plugins are
granted an enable and a disable function, which are respectively called when
VM is exited and when it's enabled. (I.e. plugins are disabled when VM is
enabled, and vice versa).
This is all good, but it also means auto-pairs' only way to be compatible is
to offer a way to disable itself. This is also a consequence of maps being
overwritten by force.

Auto-pairs may be instructed to use |vm-functions| to reinstate certain
mappings, but this on its own doesn't disable warnings that occur when the
mappings are overwritten in the first place. To silence these,
let |g:VM_show_warnings| = 0. While potentially not optimal, it does silence
the error output.

See |g:AutoPairsVMCompatibility| for more details on the compatibility tool.
